My Sweetest [NAME],

Happy Birthday, Tallllllll!❤ Today is the day the universe decided to bless this world with your presence, and I feel like the luckiest person alive because I get to share my life with you.  

There are no words that can truly capture how much you mean to me, but I’ll try. Every smile of yours brightens my darkest days. Every laugh of yours feels like music I never want to stop hearing. Every moment I spend with you is a treasure that I hold close to my heart. You’re not just my girlfriend, [NAME], you’re my soulmate, my best friend, my safe place, and the greatest gift life has ever given me.  

On your birthday, I want to remind you of how incredibly beautiful you are — not just on the outside, but deep within. Your kindness, your love, your dreams, and even your little quirks make you the most extraordinary person I have ever known. You make my world warmer, softer, and more colorful.  

I promise you this, my love: I’ll be here to celebrate every birthday with you, holding your hand, making you laugh, and loving you more with each passing year. No distance, no obstacle, nothing in this world could ever change the way I feel about you.  

So today, let’s celebrate *you*. Let’s celebrate your heart, your spirit, and the light you bring into everyone’s life — especially mine. May this year bring you every happiness you deserve and dreams that take you closer to everything you’ve ever wished for. And know this — with every heartbeat, I’ll be cheering you on, supporting you, and loving you endlessly.  

Happy Birthday, unofficially Mrs. Mondal. You are my everything, my always, and my forever 😊.

Your future husband (Jay Mondal)
